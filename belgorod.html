<p>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE BELGOROD STATE UNIVERSITY (Medical Faculty)
The history of our University is connected with the history of pedagogic education in Russia. The reforms of 1860s promoted the speeding-up of economy, trade and military science development and brought about the increase of educational establishments. Since 1872 special educational institutions – teaching institutes – were established.

In September 1876 in a small town Belgorod by the order of Ministry of public education the Teacher's Training Institute was established. This Institute was the ninth in Russia. From that moment the difficult but interesting way of our University has begun.
Later on in 1919 it was reorganized into a Pedagogical Institute and then it became the Teacher's Training Institute again.
In 1923 it was reorganized into a Pedagogical Secondary School.

In 1939 it became the Teacher's Training Institute again.
In 1941 when the World War II began, the Institute stopped its functioning.
In 1944 when the fascists invaders were driven out from the territory of USSR, the Institute resumed its work in Stary Oskol town as Belgorod was destroyed during the war.

After the war the institute successfully developed its activity. In 1954 the Ministry of Education of RSFSR transformed Stary Oskol Teachers' Institute into Pedagogical Institute.



In 1957 it was removed to Belgorod and placed in a building on Kommunisticheskaya street (today it’s the building of social-theological faculty, 78 Preobrazhenskaya street).

In 1966 the University moved into a new building on Stydencheskaya street.
In 1994 the Belgorod State Pedagogical Institute became the Pedagogical University.
In July 1996 in accordance with the decree of the President of RF Belgorod State University was established.
Since 2001 the University complex has been intensive growing and enlarging due to new beautiful modern-equipped buildings.

<p>In may 2009 the results of open selective competition of basic Institutions of Higher Education in Russia that make up Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) University were summed up in the Ministry of Education and Science. Competition committee chose the Belgorod State University as one of the three basic Institutions of Higher Education, where students from SCO countries will master the field of «Nanotechnology». The SCO University works as system of already existent universities in SCO-member countries (China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Republic of Kirghizia), and in observer countries (Mongolia, India, Iran, Pakistan). Being the SCO University member opened prospects of academic mobility development.







In April 2010 the Belgorod State University was granted the Research University status among 15 major Russian universities. The new status creates special conditions for development. The victory in the competition shows the acknowledgment on the federal level that BSU can not only put two-level system of personnel training for high-technology and applied researches into practice but also provide effective technology transfer in economy of Russia..</p>
